I have been a teaching assistant for many years, but I only find the difficulty of teaching until I started teaching my own course. 

It is often said that being good at a subject does not necessarily make someone a good teacher. That point is well understood. What I find to be an even more subtle and exhausting challenge is this: as a non-native speaker, I have to explain complex concepts in a second language to native speakers while simultaneously paying attention to tone and word choice. I need to make sure my expression is not interpreted as condescending, and that I do not discourage students, even unintentionally.

When a student gives an incorrect answer, even one that is far off, I cannot simply say “no.” I have to acknowledge their effort, validate any part of their reasoning that makes sense, and gently redirect them. This kind of emotional labor is already demanding for any instructor. For someone teaching in a second language, it requires an added layer of constant mental effort.

It takes time, self-awareness, and a great deal of patience — not only with students, but also with myself.

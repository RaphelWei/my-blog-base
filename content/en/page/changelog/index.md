This is where I keep track of changes to the blog — new posts, series, structure tweaks, and tiny milestones.  
A little timeline for this little internet corner.

---

## 2025

- **2025.04.03** — Started planning a new series, *Unified View*, inspired by the FTRL vs OMD post. It will explore connections between seemingly different ML concepts.
- **2025.03.02** — Decided to document my learning process in long-form series. First up: *Math Tricks for ML* and *SVM*.

## 2024

- **2024.10.18** — Picked the blog back up, after digging into the connection between FTRL and OMD.  
  That rabbit hole reminded me why I started writing in the first place.

## 2020

- **2020.07.24** — Got my domain `sihanwei.org` on Netlify for <span>$</span>10.99/year (now <span>$</span>14.99/year thanks to inflation!)
- **2020.06.27** — Moved my blog from GitHub Pages to Netlify. *(too lazy to build/deploy manually, to be honest)*
- **2017–2018** — Found GitHub Pages & Hexo during senior year. Tried building an academic homepage to help with grad school apps. Eventually switched to Hugo — it’s fast, simple, and, let’s face it, pretty cool.

### About Me

Hey, thanks for stopping by!ðŸ‘‹

I write about machine learning and optimizationâ€”mostly diving into the theory behind them. I try to stick to English, but sometimes Iâ€™ll switch it up with Chinese since itâ€™s my native tongue. Hope you enjoy hanging out here on my blog!

For more details regarding my research, please visit my academic [homepage](https://sihanwei.org).

### Timeline

+ **2020.7.24** : I got my personal domain `sihanwei.org` on Netlify for $10.99/year, finally replacing the default `*.netlify.app` URL.
+ **2020.6.27** : I moved my blog from Github Pages to Netlify. I am way too lazy to build and deploy the website on my own.
+ **2017 - 2018** : I discovered GitHub Pages and Hexo during my senior year while trying to build an academic homepage to boost my grad school applications. I eventually went with Hugo â€” itâ€™s fast, simple, and, letâ€™s face it, pretty cool.

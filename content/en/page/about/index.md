## About Me

Hi, I’m Sihan Wei --- a learner who documents the path, and lights it up for others.

I write (and think) about machine learning theory, optimization, and the occasional abstract rabbit hole.  

This blog is a space for slow thoughts: the kind that start with a proof, wander through patterns, and land somewhere in probability.

I mostly write in English, but every now and then you’ll find me posting something fun in [Chinese](https://blog.sihanwei.org/zh-cn/) --- it’s my mother tongue, and sometimes it just captures the feeling better.

For academic stuff: [Check out my research homepage](https://sihanwei.org).

Hope you enjoy hanging out here on my blog!

## About this blog

I started this blog because I once didn’t understand — and now that I do, I want to help others get there faster. This is my way of passing the torch.

This blog has two main flavors:

- **Research notes** — mostly for myself. Stuff I’m thinking about, half-finished ideas, little technical rabbit holes.  
  If you’re into optimization or ML theory, cool — you might find a gem (or at least a weird equation) here and there.

- **ML notes** — for anyone trying to make sense of machine learning.  
  I write these when I finally understand something I’ve been stuck on — hoping it saves someone else a bit of headache.

Basically: I write to figure things out. And sometimes, I hit “publish” in case it helps someone else too.

**Proofs** — because structure matters.  
**Patterns** — because abstraction connects everything.  
**Probabilities** — because uncertainty is part of all learning, and all living.

This is the lens I bring to research — and sometimes, to writing too.

## My Name

My Chinese name is **思涵**, pronounced Sī Hán in Mandarin. ([Hear it here via Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/?sl=auto&tl=en&text=%E6%80%9D%E6%B6%B5&op=translate))

It was chosen by my mom, and it means a lot to both of us.

["思"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E6%80%9D) means “to think” or “thought,” and ["涵"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E6%B6%B5) means “to forgive,” “to tolerate,” or “to be lenient.”

My mom once told me she had lived through a lot of anger and intolerance, and she hoped I’d grow into someone who thinks before speaking, and meets the world with calm and grace.

I still think about that often. And I hope to live up to the name.

## Timeline (a.k.a. Building My Little Internet Corner)

- **2020.07.24** — Got my domain `sihanwei.org` on Netlify for <span>$</span>10.99/year (now <span>$</span>14.99/year thanks to inflation!)
- **2020.06.27** — Moved my blog from GitHub Pages to Netlify. *(too lazy to build/deploy manually, to be honest)*
- **2017–2018** — Found GitHub Pages & Hexo during senior year. Tried building an academic homepage to help with grad school apps. Eventually switched to Hugo — it’s fast, simple, and, let’s face it, pretty cool.

Thanks for stopping by!

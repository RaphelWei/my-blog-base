### About Me

Hey, thanks for stopping by!👋

I write about machine learning and optimization—mostly diving into the theory behind them. I try to stick to English, but sometimes I’ll switch it up with Chinese since it’s my native tongue. Hope you enjoy hanging out here on my blog!

For more details regarding my research, please visit my academic [homepage](https://sihanwei.org).

### Misc.

My Chinese name is 思涵, pronounced Sī Hán in Mandarin. ([Hear it here via Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/?sl=auto&tl=en&text=%E6%80%9D%E6%B6%B5&op=translate))

It was given to me by my mom, and I’ve always loved it. 

["思"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E6%80%9D) means “to think” or “thought,” and ["涵"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E6%B6%B5) means “to forgive,” “to tolerate,” or “to be lenient.”

My mom once told me she had suffered from anger and intolerance, and she hoped I’d grow into someone who thinks before speaking, and who approaches others with patience and grace.

I hope I can live up to the name.

### Timeline

+ **2020.7.24** : I got my personal domain `sihanwei.org` on Netlify for <del>$10.99/year</del> (It now costs me $14.99/year since 2021), finally replacing the default `*.netlify.app` URL.
+ **2020.6.27** : I moved my blog from Github Pages to Netlify. I am way too lazy to build and deploy the website on my own.
+ **2017 - 2018** : I discovered GitHub Pages and Hexo during my senior year while trying to build an academic homepage to boost my grad school applications. I eventually went with Hugo — it’s fast, simple, and, let’s face it, pretty cool.
